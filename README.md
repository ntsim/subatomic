# subatomic.js

Render some nice particles effects on a container of your choosing. Mainly a rewrite of the original inspiration that is [`particles.js`](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/).

## Why this over `particles.js`?

The state of the `particles.js` codebase (at time of writing, `2.0.0`) leaves something to be desired and my main motivation were to provide the following advantages:

- Sensible refactoring and a clean rewrite.
- Consistent, modern code style (packed full of ES6 sugar).
- Written in Typescript for a degree of type safety (and so I could play around with it more).
