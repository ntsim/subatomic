# subatomic

Render some nice particles effects on a container of your choosing. This is mostly building on top of the work done in [`particles.js`](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/).

> This is currently a WIP and and should be used at your own discretion. It will soon be reaching a 1.0.0 release!

## Why this over `particles.js`?

The state of the `particles.js` codebase (at time of writing, `2.0.0`) leaves something to be desired and my main motivation were to provide the following advantages:

- Sensible refactoring and a clean rewrite.
- Consistent, modern code style using ES6 functionality.
- Written in Typescript for a degree of type safety (and so I could play around with it more).
- A more consistent and understandable API.
- Provides some additional features/tweaks and removes features that don't make sense.
- The author does not seem to be actively maintaining the `particles.js` project. I hope to keep an eye on this and at least make sure contributions are accepted where required.
